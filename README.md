# StudyTemplate

A template for running and maintaining an EEG study.

## First Steps

To set up the environment, first install Jupyter Lab based on setup instructions from the Python software carpentry linked below.

### Alternative Methods

If you have an alternative installation of Python, (i.e. not Anaconda) you may consider one of the methods in the subsequent paragraphs.

You may also install it via pip with: `pip install jupyterlab`. It can then be launched from the command line via `jupyter lab`. This should produce several lines of text in your terminal. Copy and paste one of the "localhost" URLs into your browser and you should be presented with the standard Jupyter interface.
