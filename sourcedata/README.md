# Source Data

As per the BIDS spec:

`sourcedata`: A directory where to store data before harmonization, reconstruction, and/or file format conversion (for example, E-Prime event logs or DICOM files).

In an EEG study, this is typically the best place to place the files you have directly taken from your amplifier.
