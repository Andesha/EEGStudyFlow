# Code

As per the BIDS spec:

`code`: A directory in which to store any code that was used to prepare the data.

For example, this may contain notebooks that take your `sourcedata`, potentially perform operations such as rereferencing or merging, and saving into BIDS format.

Other scripts may include artifact rejection, plotting workflow for investigating the data, and more.
